## About ðŸ‘‹

Just a quick exercise that was about refreshing my memory. I created a list of items using map method and some conditional rendering.

Names of skills are rendered with map method which uses imported data from a different file "skillsData.js" and based of the condition of whether a person is beginner, intermediate or expert with certain skill, a different emoji is rendered.

The data is static and its coming from a project file and not API call
